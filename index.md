### CPSC 120

* **Lab 5: Rectangle Area Calculator**  
  Lab 5 was one of my favorite projects because it helped me understand the importance of modular programming. I liked how the lab separated the code into multiple files, which made the project more organized and easier to manage. I learned how to define and use functions properly, work with header files, and apply test-driven development practices by running automated unit tests. This lab also gave me valuable experience with debugging and formatting according to the Google C++ Style Guide.
