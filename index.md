### CPSC 120

* **Lab 5: Rectangle Area + Decimal Feet Conversion**  
  Lab 5 stood out to me because it combined mathematical reasoning with modular C++ programming. In Part 1, we created a program to calculate the area of a rectangle using a clean, multi-file structure and Google-style formatting. I learned how to write functions across files, test using unit tests, and follow the C++ style guide closely. In Part 2, we built a converter for decimal feet into feet, inches, and eighths of an inch—an exercise that challenged me to work with floats, truncation, and input edge cases. This project helped me think through data representation and practical problem-solving using precise math and debugging.

* **Lab 10: California Counties (2D Vectors & Population Search)**  
  Lab 10 was a favorite of mine because it showed how C++ can be used to represent real-world data in a structured way. I learned how to store tabular data (like county names and populations) in a 2D vector of strings and search through it using functions. One of the most satisfying parts was seeing how clean and modular the code became once we separated out the logic into functions for total population, county search, and percent calculation. It gave me confidence working with both command-line arguments and data parsing. Here's the [link to my Lab 10 code](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-10-david-arsh).


* **Lab 12: Animated Gradient Generator**  
  Lab 12 was one of the most exciting labs because it combined math, programming, and visual creativity. I loved using `std::vector`, sine functions, and RGB color theory to generate an animated gradient in GIF format. It helped me understand how looping, image channels, and animation frames work together in graphics programming. Seeing my code create a smooth, colorful animation felt incredibly rewarding and reminded me why I love coding.
